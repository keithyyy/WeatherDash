This app displays weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. 

When users enter a city, the current weather will display. Indicating Temperature in Celsius, Humidity Percentage, Windspeed in KM and a UV index color coded for severity.

Just below is the weather forecast for that city over the next 5 days.

Users' search city will be listed in the column to the side just below the search. When one of those recent cities are clicked, it'll load that city's weather information.
